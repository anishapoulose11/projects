      "We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!\n"

      "I&#8217;m a big fan of the Brainwavz S1 (actually all of their headphones &#8211; have yet to be disappointed with any of their products). The S1 has been my main set for active use (e.g., workouts, runs, etc.) since the flat cable is very durable and resistant to tangles. The S5 keeps all the good features of the S1 and adds to it &#8211; the sound quality is richer and better defined.That&#8217;s not to say the S1 sounds poor &#8211; they are quite good, in fact. But the S5 are better. The highs are better defined and the midrange has more punch to it. The bass comes through clearly without moving into the harsh territory when the volume is pushed (as the S1s can do). The overall sound quality is very pleasing.The build quality seems solid &#8211; as solid as the S1 or better. I love the flat cable! I know that&#8217;s something that is not appreciated by everyone, but for me it&#8217;s been working out wonderfully. Although this (as most other Brainwavz headsets) comes with an excellent hard shell case, I usually tote my earbuds wrapped around my mp3 player in my pocket. Easy to carry; very stressful on the cables and can lead to tangles with round wires. Flat wires, especially those with a thick jacket such as these, survive that abuse with zero problems.The earbuds themselves are more sleekly shaped than the &#8220;can&#8221; style of the S1.Comfort is in line with the customary Brainwavz style, which is to say it&#8217;s outstanding. It comes with a wide range of tips to fit pretty much any ear, plus the Comply foam tips (which are my favorite). If fitted properly you end up with zero ear irritation plus excellent sound isolation and bass response.These are an over-the-ear design much like the S1. I never used that design prior to the S1 and it did take me a little time to get accustomed to it. It became second nature quickly, and the design is a lot more stable when exercising than the conventional in-ear design.These are more expensive than the S1, but you can hear the difference in price. Still, if you&#8217;re looking to keep the cost down a bit, the S1 is an excellent performer as well.Great sound, great comfort, wonderful cable design, and it comes with a solidly made case and lots of eartips. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]\n"
